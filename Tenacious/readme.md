# A Brief of the Prototype
GenAI Product Shots, will generate professional studio equivalent images of products.
GenAI Product Shots will cut the photography time, cost and resource.
We will mask the object from the image, then original image and masked image will be given as an input.
Stable diffusion will produce desirable results based on the input and prompt.
Multiple variant of these images with different colours and backgrounds can be used for product catalogue.

This section must include UML Diagrams and prototype description<br>

# Tech Stack
